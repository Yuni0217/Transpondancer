    If you run the script and it returns the following 3 outputs, then your dataloaders are working.

    1. displays the images
    2. Torch size such as ([2 ,1 ,x, x)] where 2 is the batch size of images that are being loaded,
        1 is the grayscale images and x*x is the image size.
    3. Classes of the images
